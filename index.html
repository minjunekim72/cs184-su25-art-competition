					<p>a joshua tree night</p> <hr>
					<h3>How is the artwork created?</h3>
					<p>This was done in Illustrator, with inspiration taken from my own photo I took in joshua tree national park. You can find the original photo on my website: <a href="https://xie.nz/photo">https://xie.nz/photo</a> </p><hr>

					<p>Fibonacci Mandala - A Mathematical Symphony in Color</p> <hr>
					<h3>How is the artwork created?</h3>
					<p>Math meets art! Started playing with Fibonacci spirals and couldn't stop adding colors. The rainbow gradient uses ~1,500 color-interpolated triangles, with some fractal snowflakes in the corners for fun. Generated with Python - who knew code could be this colorful?</p> <hr>

					<h3>How is the artwork created?</h3>

					<h3>Caption</h3>
					<p>"Expensive hardware is insignificant next to the power of an optimized rasterizer" - Darth Shader</p> <hr>
					<h3>How is the artwork created?</h3>
					<p>I wrote a Python script that generated an SVG file. First I looked through the given test SVG images to see the tags that would work with the rasterizer: I relied on "rect" and "polygon". The setup that consists of a background and a green lightsaber is hard-coded (needed to spend some time figuring out the SVG attributes). Death Star is implemented with a for loop that uses sin and cos functions as the angle of traversal increases. The stars have different colors and are positioned randomly using Python's "random" module. </p> <hr>

					<h3>Caption</h3>
					<p>PaletteCube</p> <hr>
					<h3>How is the artwork created?</h3>
					<p>The following work of mine is based on the idea that color space would exist physically in reality. In the work, the color space is shown as a cube in RGB color space. You can pick colors by touching the cube, like a painter's palette. I would call it "PaletteCube".
