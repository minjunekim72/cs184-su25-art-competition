					<h3>Caption</h3>
					<p>Oski summer bod</p> <hr>
					<h3>How is the artwork created?</h3>
					<p>We originally box-modeled a stretching cat in Blender (https://ibb.co/5WXw8rv2), which is why "Oski" has a long tail. After subdividing, the shape smoothed out and ended up looking more like a bear. We also used a custom shader similar to the given one, but with two main changes: we added noise to give a furry appearance, and adjusted the lighting to give the bear (subdivided cat) a brown color.</p><hr>
                    <h3>How long did this take?</h3>
                    <p>This was done over the course of a few days, serving as a break from debugging tasks like 4, 5, and 6. I'd say a total of 4 hours.</p>

					<p>From Code to Cat: A Procedural Pal</p> <hr>
					<h3>How is the artwork created?</h3>
					<p>This cat wasn't modeled by hand, but was generated entirely with a Python script that combines simple primitives like cubes and pyramids into a low-poly base mesh.

					<p>Blue & Gold Campanile</p> <hr>
					<h3>How is the artwork created?</h3>
					<p>This is a Blender model of the Berkeley Campanile at night, with added blue and gold spotlights like they do on Blue & Gold days. I created my own shader to create cone shaped spotlights that go up the sides with some additional ambient lighting. Before the first subdivision, the model has just over 150,000 triangles, and the result after one subdivision can be seen in the second half of the gif. </p> <hr>

					<p>Campanile (with bad topology, subdivided)</p> <hr>
					<h3>How is the artwork created?</h3>
					<p>I created it in Blender. Originally, I thought a .dae file was a single mesh, so I thought I had to create the whole thing from one connected mesh. Therefore, this is all one mesh.

					<h3>How is the artwork created?</h3>
					<p>I started a blender tutorial on how to create a Tie Fighter from Star Wars. Then I discovered that the model I made does not export to .dae file because I used latest version of blender. So had to remodel everything fast and from memory in the 3.0.0 version.
